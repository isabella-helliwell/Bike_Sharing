## 3.1 Gender Analysis  
    Gender is divided into 3 categories: 0=unknown, 1=Male, and 2= Female. Shown below is a graph representing the gender division vs bike trips. 
    The graph shows the first 3 hours of trip duration. It can be seen that the majority of trips last less than 1 hour, with a peak of around 4-8 minutes.
    We can also see that the majority of bike users are Males topping with 108087 trips compared to Females 34151, and unknown gender 7389 trips.

    Below, shown is the graph for trip start hours for the Gender category.If we look into what time of the day and weekday each gender prefered using bikes, 
    we can see that for both Females and Males, most trips happen Thursday starting at 6pm. With the males having the most bike trips 30749, followed by 
    Females 11336 trips. Saturday around 12pm seem to be the preferred start bike trip time for gender Unknown, with 5669 trips.

   Furthermore, if we look into the different gender proportions of user type, i.e customers ( 24 hour pass or 3-day pass users) and Subscriber (Annual Members),
   we can see from Graph below, that the majority of the bike trips occur once again for the Subscriber Male with 259316 trips.
